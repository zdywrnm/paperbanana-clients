render_worker.py — sandboxed matplotlib renderer.

This module executes ONE plot job. The untrusted (LLM-generated) code is run
inside a freshly-SPAWNED CHILD PROCESS (see run_render below), never in the
FastAPI worker process.

SECURITY MODEL — read this carefully. The REAL security boundary is NOT the
Python "restricted builtins" trick. CPython cannot safely run hostile code
in-process: a determined attacker WILL escape the builtins whitelist (e.g. via
().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() or fn.__globals__["__builtins__"]
["__import__"]) and reach the genuine os/subprocess. We assume that escape
happens. The boundary that actually contains the damage is, in order:

  1. SCRUBBED, SECRET-FREE CHILD ENVIRONMENT. The child is spawned with an
     explicit minimal env (PATH, MPLBACKEND=Agg, HOME, MPLCONFIGDIR, LANG)
     and NOTHING else. PLOT_WORKER_TOKEN and every other inherited secret are
     stripped before the child exists. So even a FULL Python escape that
     reaches os.environ finds no secret to exfiltrate — os.environ is empty of
     anything sensitive. This is layer #1 of the boundary and lives in this
     file (run_render) + app.py (which deletes the token from os.environ at
     startup and keeps it only in a private module variable for auth).
  2. CONTAINER NETWORK-EGRESS DENY. A Kubernetes NetworkPolicy
     (networkpolicy.yaml) denies ALL egress from the pod. Even if escaped code
     reaches a real socket, it cannot reach the internet or internal services,
     so it cannot phone home with whatever it scraped. See README.
  3. READ-ONLY ROOT FILESYSTEM + NON-ROOT UID + DROPPED CAPABILITIES, set at
     deploy time (see README). Escaped code cannot tamper with the image,
     write outside tmpfs, or escalate.
  4. RESOURCE LIMITS (POSIX RLIMIT_CPU / RLIMIT_AS / RLIMIT_FSIZE /
     RLIMIT_NPROC where available) cap CPU / memory / file-write / fork blast
     radius. The PARENT additionally enforces a hard WALL-CLOCK timeout and
     kills the child if it hangs (CPU-limit only fires on CPU time, not on
     sleep()/blocking I/O).

DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH ONLY (NOT the boundary): the child also forces matplotlib Agg,
runs user code under a restricted __builtins__ whitelist, and uses a guarded
__import__ that allows only a plotting allowlist and denies os/subprocess/etc.
by name. These RAISE THE COST of a casual escape and stop accidental imports,
but they are explicitly NOT relied on to contain a hostile attacker — layers
1–4 are. Do not re-document these as the boundary.

'spawn' (not fork) is used so the child gets a clean interpreter with none of
the parent's open sockets / DB handles / file descriptors.

Residual risk and the full deploy checklist are documented in README.md.
