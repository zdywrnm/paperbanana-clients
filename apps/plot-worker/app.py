"""
app.py — FastAPI front end for the sandboxed matplotlib plot worker.

Endpoints:
  POST /render  {code, token}  -> {ok, image_base64 (PNG), error?}
  GET  /health                 -> {ok: true, runtime: "plot-worker"}

Auth:
  If PLOT_WORKER_TOKEN is set in the environment, every /render request MUST
  present a matching token, either as the `X-Plot-Worker-Token` header or as a
  `token` field in the JSON body. Mismatch / missing -> 401. If the env var is
  NOT set, the service runs OPEN (intended only for local dev / a network with
  no egress). The README spells out the deployment expectations.

This process NEVER exec()s the untrusted code itself; it delegates to
render_worker.run_render, which SPAWNS a hardened, secret-free child. See
render_worker.py and README.md for the security model.

SECRET HANDLING: the auth token is read ONCE at import into a private module
variable and then DELETED from os.environ (see _PLOT_WORKER_TOKEN below). The
parent keeps the cached copy for auth; the variable is never forwarded to the
render child. Because it is gone from os.environ, the spawned child cannot
inherit it even in the (locked, but belt-and-suspenders) window in
render_worker.run_render — a full Python escape in the child finds no token to
exfiltrate. The REAL boundary is the scrubbed child env + the no-egress
NetworkPolicy + a read-only / non-root container + resource limits, NOT the
restricted-builtins trick (which is defense-in-depth only).
